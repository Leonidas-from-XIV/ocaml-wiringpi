* Use
To use it just run
: make
and then ./sapin_noel.bin

* Goal
This script uses the wiringPi library http://wiringpi.com/ (thank you for your job) and adapt it in order to make it usable in Ocaml. Must common functions are implemented (see wiringPiOcaml.ml) but lot's a function aren't present for the moment. It's very simple to add these functions, so you can add them and if you want I can add your modifications.

There is too a little script to use shift registers.

Enjoy !
